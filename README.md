The Repository Design Pattern is a structural pattern that provides an abstraction layer, or an interface, for accessing and manipulating data in a consistent manner. It acts as a mediator between the business logic and the data source, such as a database, file system, or external service. The primary purpose of the Repository Pattern is to separate the logic that retrieves data from the underlying storage from the rest of the application.

Key Components of the Repository Design Pattern:

Repository Interface:
Defines the contract for how data should be accessed and manipulated. It typically includes methods like Get, Add, Update, and Delete for various entities.

Concrete Repository:
Implements the repository interface and provides the actual implementation of data access logic, interacting with the underlying data source.

Entity:
Represents the business object or data entity for which the repository provides access. Entities are typically the objects that map to the data in the storage.

Benefits of the Repository Design Pattern:

Abstraction of Data Access Logic:
Provides a clean and consistent interface for data access, abstracting away the details of how data is stored or retrieved.

Centralized Data Access Logic:
Centralizes data access logic in one place, making it easier to manage and maintain.

Separation of Concerns:
Separates the business logic from the data access logic, improving the modularity and maintainability of the code.

Promotes Testability:
Facilitates easier unit testing by allowing the substitution of a mock repository during testing, without touching the actual data source.

Encapsulation of Query Logic:
Encapsulates query logic within the repository, preventing direct exposure of complex queries in the application code.
